# SCOPE
The analyze_auto_analyzer tool takes an input data file from WTX and averages the data from each sampling point; for chlorine samples, the average is reported on a weekly timeframe. For all other analyte, the average is reported on a monthly timeframe.


# USE
You must input the full path including the file extension as the input file location. When prompted for where the resultant files should be stored, the input should be the path to the desired directory, it should not be a path to a file.
